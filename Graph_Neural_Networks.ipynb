        "* To classify these jets using GNNs, we must first convert each jet's point cloud into a graph structure. One common approach is to use a distance metric to define edges between points that are close together and then represent each point as a node in the graph. \n",
        "* However, this approach can lead to dense and computationally expensive graphs. Instead, we will use the JetGraph architecture proposed in [1], which constructs a sparse graph based on angular distances between pairs of particles in a jet. \n",
        "* Specifically, JetGraph first identifies the jet's axis and then projects each particle onto a plane perpendicular to the jet axis. The angular distance between two particles is the angle between their projections. Edges are then constructed between particles within a certain angular distance of each other, resulting in a sparse graph representative of the jet's substructure.\n",

By converting the point clouds into graph structures, we can leverage GNNs to capture complex relationships between the particles in a jet and achieve high classification accuracy. The JetGraph architecture, in particular, is well-suited for this task, as it can construct a sparse graph that captures the jet's substructure while avoiding the computational cost of dense graphs.\n",
